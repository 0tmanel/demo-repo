# SSH
SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol used to securely connect to remote computers. It allows you to execute commands, transfer files, and manage systems over an unsecured network, such as the internet.
SSH ensures that the communication between the client and the server is encrypted, which prevents eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

The default port for SSH is 22
# Basic SSH Components
1: SSH Client: A program that allows you to initiate the connection to a remote server (e.g., ssh command).
2 : SSH Server: A program that listens for incoming SSH connections on the remote machine. Typically, this is provided by sshd (SSH Daemon) in Unix-like systems.
3 : SSH Key Pair: Used for secure authentication, consisting of a private key (kept secret) and a public key (shared with the remote system).
# Setting Up SSH in Kali Linux
To connect to a remote machine with the IP 192.168.1.10 as the user root:

ssh root@192.168.1.10
When you connect to a server for the first time, SSH will ask you to confirm the server’s authenticity (via its host key fingerprint). Once confirmed, you will be prompted to enter the password for the remote system.
# Starting the SSH Server (sshd)
The SSH server is managed by the sshd service. If you want to allow SSH connections to your Kali Linux machine (or any other system), you need to ensure the SSH server is running.

Install SSH Server (if not installed)
On Kali, you can install the SSH server using the following command:

sql
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
Start/Stop the SSH Service
You can start and stop the SSH server with systemctl:

Start SSH server:

sudo systemctl start ssh

Enable SSH server to start on boot:

sudo systemctl enable ssh
Stop SSH server:


sudo systemctl stop ssh
 # SSH Agent and Forwarding
An SSH Agent stores your private keys and provides them to the SSH client when connecting to a remote server, so you don’t have to manually enter your passphrase each time.

# Remote Port Forwarding
Remote port forwarding allows you to forward traffic from a remote server's port to your local machine.

Example:
ssh -R 9090:localhost:3000 user@192.168.1.10

# Local Port Forwarding
Local port forwarding allows you to forward traffic from a local port to a remote server's port.

Example:

ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 user@192.168.1.10

# ProxyChains 
ProxyChains is a popular Linux tool used to route network traffic through multiple proxy servers, typically for anonymity and privacy. It acts as a proxy wrapper, meaning it can route applications' traffic (such as web browsers or other networked software) through one or more proxy servers, effectively masking the user's real IP address.
Anonymity and Privacy: By routing your traffic through different proxies, ProxyChains increases the level of anonymity. This is often used for:

Masking IP addresses when browsing the internet or accessing services.
Bypassing geo-restrictions and firewalls.
Evading IP-based bans or surveillance.

# ####### FTP GET Command
The GET command is used to download files from the FTP server to the local machine (the client). When you use GET, you're asking the FTP server to send a specified file to your local system.

GET <remote file> <local file>
remote file: The path and filename of the file on the FTP server.
local file: (Optional) The path and filename where you want to save the file locally.
If you omit the local filename, the file is saved with the same name it has on the server.

Example:
To download a file called example.txt from the server:

GET example.txt
To download it and save it locally as newfile.txt:

GET example.txt newfile.txt
# 2. FTP PUT Command
The PUT command is used to upload files from the local machine to the FTP server. When you use PUT, you're instructing the server to save a specified local file.


PUT <local file> <remote file>
local file: The path and filename of the file on your local machine.
remote file: (Optional) The path and filename where you want to save the file on the server
