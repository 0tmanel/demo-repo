 # ########## Updatedb :
  The updatedb command is used to update the database for the locate command on Unix-like operating systems. It creates or updates a database that contains a list of all the files and directories on the system, which can then be quickly searched using the locate command.
 After the database is updated, you can use the locate command to quickly search for files. For example, locate filename will return a list of all paths that contain "filename", and it will be much faster than a traditional find command because itâ€™s searching an indexed database instead of scanning the filesystem in real-time.

 # ########### Locate :

 The locate command is used to quickly search for files and directories on your system by querying a pre-built index (database) of file paths. This allows for much faster searching compared to the find command, which searches the filesystem in real time.
 This performs a simple substring search. It will return any file whose name or path contains word.txt at any position, not necessarily at the end of the file name.

 Fast Search: Since locate uses an indexed database, it can return results very quickly, even on large filesystems, unlike find, which searches the filesystem in real-time.

Database Update: The results from locate are only as up-to-date as the last time updatedb was run. If you have added new files or directories recently, you might need to run updatedb manually to refresh the database.

locate <pattern>

Where <pattern> is the string you want to search for. For example, to find all files containing the word config in their names:

locate *.config / locate word.txt

locate -c :
-c does not display file paths; it just gives you the count of matching entries.
locate -c *.txt
This command will count how many .txt files are in the locate database and return that count, without showing the file paths.

locate -r </pattern$> regex
The result includes only those files whose names end with pattern, and the path must end exactly with that string (because of the $).
//The -i option stands for case-insensitive search
//The -S option is used to show statistics about the locate database.

# ######### Find
Searches for files and directories in real-time based on a variety of conditions (e.g., name, size, permissions, type).

find <path> -name <pattern>

How it Works: find scans the filesystem directly, checking each directory and file according to the conditions you provide.

1: Search by File Name (-name and -iname):
-name <pattern>: Search for files whose name matches the pattern.
-iname <pattern>: Same as -name, but case-insensitive.

2: Search by File Type (-type):
-type f: Search for regular files (default).
-type d: Search for directories.
-type l: Search for symbolic links.
-type b: Search for block devices.
-type c: Search for character devices.

# 3: Search by File Size (-size):
-size <n>: Find files of size n blocks. (1 block = 512 bytes by default, but this can vary.)
-size +n: Find files larger than n blocks.
-size -n: Find files smaller than n blocks.
You can specify the size in different units, like k (kilobytes), M (megabytes), G (gigabytes).

# 4: Search by Modification Time (-mtime, -atime, -ctime):
-mtime <n>: Finds files modified exactly n days ago.
-mtime +n: Finds files modified more than n days ago.
-mtime -n: Finds files modified less than n days ago.
-atime: Finds files accessed n days ago.
-ctime: Finds files whose metadata (like ownership or permissions) was changed n days ago.

# 5: Executing Commands on Found Files (-exec):

find /home/user -name "*.log" -exec rm {} \;

-exec <command> {} \;: Executes a command on each file that matches the criteria. The {} is replaced by the file path, and the \; ends the command.
-exec <command> {} +: Executes the command on multiple files at once, improving efficiency.

# The -maxdepth and -mindepth options in the find command are used to control how deep the search should go into the directory tree. These options allow you to limit the depth of the search, making it more efficient or focused depending on your needs.

find /home/user -maxdepth 2 -name "*.txt"
#  "*" at the begin is searching for the end of a word, and "*"the end is searching for the begining of a word

Explanation: This will search for .txt files within /home/user, but only search in the directory /home/user and its immediate subdirectories (i.e., 2 levels deep).
It will not search within subdirectories of subdirectories (e.g., /home/user/dir1/dir2).

-Print: Default action that displays the path name of the files that meet the given criteria

# which and whence
This command is used to find out where the specified application program or system utility is stored on the disk.

which <program_name/utility>
Here, <program_name/utility> represents the command or programs whose location we wish
to find out.
Example $ which ls 
Output /usr/bin/ls
