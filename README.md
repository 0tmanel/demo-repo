# In Git, an untracked file refers to a file that exists in your working directory but is not being tracked by Git. This means that Git is not yet aware of the file, and it is not part of the version control system. Essentially, Git does not know about any changes to this file, and it won't include it in commits unless you explicitly add it to the staging area.
