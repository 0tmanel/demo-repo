//i need to know API socket

//I need to handle HTTP protocols, so covering HTTP methods, status codes, headers, and parsing requests and responses is important.

//Concurrency is another big part. They might not realize that handling multiple clients at once requires forking or threading. Maybe mention multiprocessing vs. multithreading and async I/O. Also, security aspects like input validation and buffer overflows are essential to prevent vulnerabilities.

//I have considered the practical steps like setting up a server loop, binding ports, listening for connections, and reading/writing data over sockets. Including project milestones could help them structure their learning

/*
1. C Programming Fundamentals
Pointers and Memory Management: Web servers handle dynamic data (requests/responses), so understanding pointers, malloc, free, and avoiding memory leaks is critical.

File I/O: Reading files (e.g., HTML, images) from disk to serve over HTTP.

String Manipulation: Parsing HTTP headers and URLs.

Network Byte Order: Understanding htonl, htons, ntohl, ntohs for handling data across networks.

2. Network Programming
Socket Programming: Learn the basics of sockets (TCP/UDP) using the <sys/socket.h> API.

socket(), bind(), listen(), accept(), connect(), send(), recv(), close().

IP Addresses and Ports: Understand IPv4/IPv6 addressing and port binding.

Blocking vs. Non-blocking Sockets: Decide whether your server will handle connections synchronously or asynchronously.

3. HTTP Protocol Basics
HTTP Methods: GET, POST, etc.

Status Codes: 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error, etc.

Headers: Parsing headers like Content-Type, Content-Length, and Connection.

Request/Response Format: Study the structure of HTTP messages (e.g., GET /index.html HTTP/1.1).

MIME Types: Mapping file extensions to MIME types (e.g., text/html, image/png).

4. Concurrency and Multiplexing
Multiprocessing: Using fork() to handle multiple clients (process-per-connection model).

Multithreading: Using pthreads for a thread-per-connection model.

I/O Multiplexing: Efficiently handle multiple connections with select(), poll(), or epoll() (Linux-specific).

Asynchronous I/O: Optional for high-performance servers (e.g., libuv or io_uring).

5. Security Considerations
Input Validation: Sanitize user input to avoid path traversal attacks (e.g., ../../../etc/passwd).

Buffer Overflows: Avoid vulnerabilities by using safe functions like snprintf instead of sprintf.

Resource Limits: Limit the number of open connections to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

HTTPS (Optional): To add TLS/SSL encryption, study libraries like OpenSSL.

6. System Calls and POSIX APIs
Signal Handling: Gracefully handle signals like SIGINT (Ctrl+C) to clean up resources.

File Descriptors: Manage sockets and files using file descriptors.

Error Handling: Check return codes for system calls (e.g., perror, errno).

7. Project Structure
Server Loop: A loop that listens for incoming connections and dispatches handlers.

Request Parsing: Extract the HTTP method, path, headers, and body from incoming requests.

Response Generation: Build HTTP responses dynamically (e.g., serving static files or handling routes).

Configuration: Allow customization (e.g., port number, root directory) via command-line arguments or config files.

Key Milestones for Your Server
Basic TCP Server: Accept connections and send a "Hello World" response.

HTTP Compliance: Handle GET requests for static files (e.g., HTML, CSS).

Concurrency: Add support for multiple clients using threads or epoll.

Error Handling: Return proper HTTP status codes (e.g., 404, 500).

Security: Add input validation and resource limits.

Advanced Features: Optional support for POST, cookies, or reverse proxying.

// this is for basic web server 

Let’s start with a simple single-threaded web server in C that handles one client at a time. I’ll guide you step-by-step with explanations and code.

Step 1: Basic TCP Server
Here’s a minimal example that listens for incoming connections and sends a "Hello World" response:
*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define PORT 8080
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024

int main() {
    int server_fd, client_fd;
    struct sockaddr_in server_addr, client_addr;
    socklen_t client_len = sizeof(client_addr);
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE] = {0};

    // 1. Create a socket
    server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    if (server_fd < 0) {
        perror("Socket creation failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // 2. Configure server address
    server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;           // IPv4
    server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;   // Listen on all interfaces
    server_addr.sin_port = htons(PORT);         // Port 8080

    // 3. Bind the socket to the port
    if (bind(server_fd, (struct sockaddr*)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr)) < 0) {
        perror("Bind failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // 4. Listen for incoming connections
    if (listen(server_fd, 10) < 0) {  // Backlog of 10 connections
        perror("Listen failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    printf("Server listening on port %d...\n", PORT);

    // 5. Main server loop
    while (1) {
        // Accept a connection
        client_fd = accept(server_fd, (struct sockaddr*)&client_addr, &client_len);
        if (client_fd < 0) {
            perror("Accept failed");
            continue;  // Keep running even if one connection fails
        }

        // Read the client's request (we'll ignore it for now)
        read(client_fd, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE);
        printf("Received request:\n%s\n", buffer);

        // Send a basic HTTP response
        char *response = 
            "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n"
            "Content-Type: text/plain\n"
            "\n"
            "Hello from your C web server!";
        write(client_fd, response, strlen(response));

        // Close the connection
        close(client_fd);
    }

    // Close the server socket (unreachable in this loop)
    close(server_fd);
    return 0;
}
/*
Step 2: Compile and Run
Save the code as server.c.

Compile it using gcc:

bash
Copy
gcc server.c -o server
Run the server:

bash
Copy
./server
Open a browser and visit http://localhost:8080, or use curl:

bash
Copy
curl http://localhost:8080
You’ll see the message "Hello from your C web server!".

Key Concepts Explained
Socket Creation (socket()):

AF_INET: Use IPv4.

SOCK_STREAM: Use TCP (reliable, connection-oriented).

Binding (bind()):

Attach the socket to port 8080 on all network interfaces (INADDR_ANY).

Listening (listen()):

Start listening for incoming connections. The 10 is the backlog (max queued connections).

Accepting Connections (accept()):

Blocks until a client connects, then returns a new socket (client_fd) for communication.

HTTP Response:

A valid HTTP response has headers (status code, content type) followed by a blank line and the body.

Next Steps for Improvement
Handle Multiple Clients:

Use fork() or threads to handle multiple clients simultaneously.

Serve Files:

Parse the request path (e.g., GET /index.html HTTP/1.1), read the file from disk, and send it.

Add Error Handling:

Return 404 Not Found if a file doesn’t exist.

Parse Headers:

Extract headers like User-Agent or Content-Length.

Example: Serve Static Files
Here’s how to modify the code to serve a file (e.g., index.html):


// Inside the main loop after accepting a connection:

// Read the request
read(client_fd, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE);

// Extract the path (simplified)
char *path = strtok(buffer, " ");  // Get "GET"
path = strtok(NULL, " ");          // Get "/index.html"

// Open the file
FILE *file = fopen(path + 1, "r");  // Skip the leading '/'
if (file == NULL) {
    // Send 404 response
    char *response = "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\n\nFile not found!";
    write(client_fd, response, strlen(response));
} else {
    // Send 200 response with file content
    char *header = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html\n\n";
    write(client_fd, header, strlen(header));

    char file_buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    while (fgets(file_buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, file) != NULL) {
        write(client_fd, file_buffer, strlen(file_buffer));
    }
    fclose(file);
}
Common Pitfalls
Port Conflicts: Ensure port 8080 is free (or use sudo for ports <1024).

Memory Leaks: Always close() sockets and free() allocated memory.

Blocking Calls: The server blocks on accept() and read(). For non-blocking I/O, use select() or epoll.
