//The bitmask indicates which bits are to be affected by the operation. The idea is to operate on a variable, changing or affecting only the bits indicated by the bitmask:
//variable → bitmask (bit N) → variable (only bit N changed)

//common bitmask operations work on a single bit: set the bit, clear the bit, or query the value of the bit. Each of these operations can be accomplished through the following logic:

//set Nth bit  ===> x = x | (1<<N);
//clear Nth bit===> x = x & (~(1<<N));
//read Nth bit ===> (x & (1<<N)) >>N;
int main ()
{
    //setting a bit
    printf("this result is for the part of setting a bit\n");
    unsigned char  j = 17; //00010001
    j = j | (1<< 3);
    printf("%d\n", j);
    /*i = i | (1 << 3);
This is where the bit manipulation happens. Let’s break it down:

1 << 3:
The number 1 in binary is 00000001.
Shifting 1 left by 3 positions (1 << 3) results in:
csharp
Copy code
00001000  (which is 8 in decimal)
Now, we perform the bitwise OR (|) operation between i (which is 17 or 00010001) and the result of 1 << 3 (which is 8 or 00001000).

Let's do the bitwise OR operation step by step:

markdown
Copy code
00010001  (i = 17)
OR
00001000  (1 << 3 = 8)
-----------------------
00011001  (Result = 25)*/

//clearing a bit 
printf("this result is for the part of clearing a bit\n");
unsigned char  a = 17;
a=a & (~(1<<4));
printf("%d\n",a);
/*~(1 << 4)
This part performs two operations:

Left shift (1 << 4):
The binary representation of 1 is 00000001.
Shifting 1 left by 4 positions (1 << 4) results in:
csharp
Copy code
00010000  (which is 16 in decimal)
NOT (~) operation:
The ~ (bitwise NOT) inverts all the bits of 00010000, turning it into:
kotlin
Copy code
11101111  (this is `-17` in two's complement, but we're only interested in the bits)
So, the result of ~(1 << 4) is:

css
Copy code
11101111  (a mask where the 4th bit is 0 and all others are 1)
Bitwise AND Operation (a & ~(1 << 4)):

c
Copy code
a = a & (~(1 << 4));
Now, we perform the bitwise AND operation between a (which is 17 or 00010001 in binary) and the result of ~(1 << 4) (which is 11101111 in binary).

Let's do the bitwise AND operation step by step:

markdown
Copy code
00010001  (a = 17)
AND
11101111  (~(1 << 4))
-----------------------
