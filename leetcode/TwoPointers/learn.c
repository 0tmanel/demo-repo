//The two-pointer technique is a powerful and efficient approach used in many algorithms to solve problems that involve arrays, strings, or linked lists. It works by using two pointers (or indices) that move towards each other or in different directions to perform certain operations. This technique can significantly reduce the time complexity of some problems compared to brute force solutions.

/*
When to Use Two Pointers:
When you need to traverse a data structure efficiently.
The two-pointer approach can reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) in many problems.

When the problem involves sorting or partitioning.
Problems like the "two-sum" problem, merging sorted arrays, or partitioning based on a condition can benefit from this approach.

When you want to avoid nested loops.
The two-pointer method often eliminates the need for nested loops, reducing complexity.
