hello, my name is othman , i am using this file to test 
my program which function mainly about imitating the behavour of the system command tail
this command is about displaying the last line of the file given as argument
we have also another option which is -c , this option is used to disply the last characters
displyed , therefor i am going to look for a way how to do this 
the behavour of the command tail is that it disply the last ten 
lines in a file by default 
therefor we need to see an algorithm to solve this problem 
also how to show the last specified characters
because we are asked to handle this option
as for the makefile, it is super  easy 
now we are at the last line in the file 
because we want to test our program 
take care of yourself
