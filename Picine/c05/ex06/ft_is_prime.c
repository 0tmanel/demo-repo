//A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. So, you can check if a number is divisible by any number between 2 and nâˆ’1. 
//If it is divisible by any of them, it's not prime.

//When we say that one number is divisible by another, it means that when you divide the first number by the second number, there is no remainder

//Current approach (using square root): You only check up to sqrt(nb). This significantly reduces the number of iterations, especially for larger values. For example, for nb = 10,000, you only need to check up to 100 (since sqrt(10,000) = 100), which is a big reduction in the number of checks.
 //inefficient approach: You check all numbers from 2 to nb-1. For larger values of nb, this becomes computationally expensive (for example, checking all numbers up to 10,000 for nb = 10,000). /*while (i < n)*
