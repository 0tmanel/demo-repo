//A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. So, you can check if a number is divisible by any number between 2 and nâˆ’1.

//Current approach (using square root): You only check up to sqrt(nb). This significantly reduces the number of iterations, especially for larger values. For example, for nb = 10,000, you only need to check up to 100 (since sqrt(10,000) = 100), which is a big reduction in the number of checks.
 //inefficient approach: You check all numbers from 2 to nb-1. For larger values of nb, this becomes computationally expensive (for example, checking all numbers up to 10,000 for nb = 10,000). /*while (i < n)*

// To check if a number is prime, you want to ensure that it is only divisible by 1 and itself, and not by any other numbers in between. The more efficient approach is to check for divisibility starting from 2 up to the square root of the number (because if a number is divisible by any number larger than its square root, the other divisor will necessarily be smaller than the square root).
//If a number is even and greater than 2, it is not prime.
