 //the compiler actually maintains a single system stack. Each time a call to a function occurs, all its parameters and local variables are pushed onto the stack along with the memory address of the calling statement. This address gives the computer the return point after execution of the function. Although mul- tiple copies of a functionâ€™s parameters may be saved on the stack, only one copy of the function body is in memory.
