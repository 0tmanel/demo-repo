//Dynamic memory allocation uses a pointer variable to request memory from the O/S while the program is running. The basic function call for dynamic mem- ory allocation is malloc() it is found in t'library stdlib.h]

#include <stdlib.h>  /* header file for malloc() */
int main(){

             double  *a;          /* pointer variable */
             a = (double *) malloc(40);
            

//The typecast identifies the type of pointer arithmetic expected for the address returned from malloc(). The malloc() function call is the request to the O/S for memory. It takes one parameter, which is the number of bytes needed. In this example, we request 40 bytes, which is 5 doubles (8 bytes per double).
//One of the primary jobs of the O/S is to manage memory. A malloc() call asks the O/S for a chunk of memory of the given size. The chunk of memory is obtained from an area of memory called the heap.

//Dynamically allocated memory does not have an existing label, so we use [DM] to temporarily provide it a name. In order to give it a name that our program can use, we must use either pointer or array syntax based upon the variable a. Every cell of memory in the chunk of bytes has both a pointer-based label and an array-based label and can be accessed using either syntax. 

//Every time a function ends, its statically declared memory is released from the stack and returned to the O/S. Dynamic memory allocation is different. Because the allocation can be made at any point in a program, the program must also be responsible for releasing the memory and returning it to the O/S. This is done by calling the free() function:\\
free(a);

//Failure to call the free() function appropriately may result in a program losing track of the memory it uses. Sometimes this is referred to as a memory leak. For example, consider the following code:
             double *b;
             b=(double *)malloc(70);
             b=(double *)malloc(300);  /* memory leak */
             
    //The program requests 70 bytes from the O/S, and then 300 bytes, each time storing the address of the bytes in a. But the second request overwrites the address of the first request. What happens to those 70 bytes? They are still reserved for use by the program, but the program has lost any record of the address where they reside! This is a common programming mistake and can lead to a program crashing.

   ###### Differences Between Arrays and Pointers#####
   
There are several differences between the use of arrays and the use of pointers to arrays. In this section, we will use the vector array and pv pointer as defined below:

int vector[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
 int *pv = vector;

The code generated by vector[i] is different from the code generated by vector+i. The notation vector[i] generates machine code that starts at location vector, moves i positions from this location, and uses its content. The notation vector+i generates machine code that starts at location vector, adds i to the address, and then uses the contents at that address. While the result is the same, the generated machine code is different. This difference is rarely of significance to most programmers.

There is a difference when the sizeof operator is applied to an array and to a pointer to the same array. Applying the sizeof operator to vector will return 20, the number of bytes allocated to the array. Applying the sizeof operator against pv will return 4, the pointerâ€™s size.

The pointer pv is an lvalue. An lvalue denotes the term used on the lefthand side of an assignment operator. An lvalue must be capable of being modified. An array name such as vector is not an lvalue and cannot be modified. The address assigned to an array cannot be changed . A pointer can be assigned a new value and reference a different section of memory.
Consider the following:

pv = pv + 1;

vector = vector + 1; // Syntax error
We cannot modify vector, only its contents. However, the expression vector+1 is fine, as demonstrated below:
pv = vector + 1;
