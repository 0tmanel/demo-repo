        //Why Use i < size - 1 in Sorting Algorithms?
//In sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, the reason we use i < size - 1 
//(or similar conditions) is because each pass through the array places at least 
//one element in its correct final position. By the end of the first pass, 
//the largest element is placed at the end of the array; on the second pass, 
//the second largest element is placed at the second-to-last position, and so on.
//Hereâ€™s why i < size - 1 is useful:

//After each pass of the inner loop 
//(comparison and possible swapping), the largest element 
//that hasn't been sorted yet gets placed at the end of the array. 
//This means the last element of the array is correctly positioned,
 //so you don't need to compare it again.

//After the first pass, you know that the largest element is at the last position,
 //so the number of elements to compare in the next pass can be reduced by one.
  //Therefore, you don't need to perform a full loop for 
  //i = size - 1 because the last element is already sorted.

   ////*******SELECTION SORT****** **\\\\\*  It is 60 per cent more efficient than bubble sort.
//Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that has a quadratic running 
//time complexity of O(n2), thereby making it inefficient
// to be used on large lists.Selection sort is generally used for sorting files
//with very large objects (records) and small keys.
