//One reason to use strnstr() instead of strstr() would be to save time. Obviously searching only n characters is faster than searching what could be a very long string. I can imagine other reasons to use it, but mostly Iâ€™ve used strstr() in my code.
//it is the same as strstr,  just in strnstr we add i < len at the outer loop and i + j < len in the inner
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>

        size_t j = 0;
        while(haystack[i + j] == needle[j] && needle[j] != '\0' && i + j < len)
